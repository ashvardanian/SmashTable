 *  @brief What a GenMC client takes from the verifier: threads, and the assertion it reports with
 *      the execution graph that broke it.
 *
 *  GenMC intercepts these by name. The platform's @c pthread_create it does not, and @c std::thread
 *  rides on that, so every client spawns through here. The clients compile against the platform's
 *  standard library rather than GenMC's freestanding replacement, which `check.sh` arranges by
 *  forwarding the header names GenMC shadows.
